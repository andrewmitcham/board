            I have spent a lot of time, for learning in IT sphere,
            but became interested programming some time ago.
            On this way i have met some problems, but never gave up,
            and i have a lot of targets, such as writing cryptocurrency.
            My approach is concluded in peace and rest,
            so at this time I tried to collect useful knowledge.
            Hopefully we can help each other,
            and i will not justify himself, because i'm too weak.

            I had some work and orders on private boards,
            and know linux - based system, with Azure / Amazon services.
            Was interested on network technology stack,
            and received practical experience in team development.
            Have low or middle language level,
            "I'll try my best, but my best wasn't good enough" :)
            I will try work harder, just give me chance;
            Thank for your patience. Sorry for my "pride approach".
