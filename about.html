            I have spent a lot of time, for learning in IT sphere,
            but became interested programming some time ago.
            My approach is concluded in peace and rest,
            so at this time I tried to collect useful knowledge.
            Hopefully we can help each other,
            and i will not justify himself, because i'm too weak.
            I will try work harder, just give me chance;
            Thank for your patience. Sorry for my "pride approach".

            I had some work and orders on private boards,
            and received practical experience in team development.
            Have low or middle language level,
            "I'll try my best, but my best wasn't good enough" :)
            On this way i have met some problems, but never gave up,
            and i have a lot of targets, such as writing cryptocurrency.
            I have reserve of disorganized knowledge;
            was interested on Social Engineering Toolkit.
